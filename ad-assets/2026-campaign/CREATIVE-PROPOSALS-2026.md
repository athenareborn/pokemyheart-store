## 💭 ADDITIONAL IDEAS TO EXPLORE

### 1. Mother's Day Angle (May 2026)
- "She chose you first. Now choose her."
- Test in April for Mother's Day 2026

### 2. Anniversary Cards (Year-Round)
- Same product, "Happy Anniversary" messaging
- Lower volume but year-round revenue
- FAILED in Q4 2025 - needs Valentine's urgency

### 3. LGBTQ+ Inclusive Designs
- Already have designs in folder
- Consider separate campaign or add to mix
- "Love is love. Say 'I choose you.'"

### 4. Galentine's Day (Feb 13)
- Best friend angle
- "For the bestie who's been there through every gym battle"

### 5. Bundle Upsell Copy
- Push Valentine's Pack over Card Only
- "Display case included—because this deserves to be shown off"

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

1. **NOW:** Add 30th Anniversary hook to existing campaign (Copy F or G)
2. **THIS WEEK:** Test Anti-Flowers angle (Copy J)
3. **FEB 1:** Rotate in social proof copy if performing
4. **FEB 8:** Switch to urgency copy
5. **POST-VDAY:** Document learnings for 2027

## 📝 NOTES

**What's proven (keep doing):**
- "Not just for Pokémon fans" (audience expansion)
- "Limited edition" (scarcity)
- "Holographic/shiny" (product feature)
- "I choose you" (emotional hook)

**What's new to test:**
- 30th anniversary angle (timely)
- Anti-generic Valentine's (problem-aware)
- Social proof numbers (credibility)
- Direct/simple copy (pattern interrupt)

**What to avoid:**
- Evergreen positioning (failed in Q4 2025)
- Australia references (US campaign)
- Multiple CTAs
- Generic Valentine's messaging without hook
