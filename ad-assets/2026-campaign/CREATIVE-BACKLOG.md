## Video Ideas (Future)

3. **Unboxing** - Focus on the Valentine's Pack unboxing experience

## Notes

**What's working (from 2025):**
- Audience expansion hooks ("not just for Pokémon fans")
- Limited edition scarcity
- "I choose you" emotional trigger
- Holographic/shiny product feature callouts

**What to avoid:**
- Evergreen positioning (failed Q4 2025)
- Generic Valentine's messaging without unique hook
- Multiple CTAs in single ad
- Australia-specific references (US campaign)

---
