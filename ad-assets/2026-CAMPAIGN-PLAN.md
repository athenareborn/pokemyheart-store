# Pokemyheart Valentine's 2026 Campaign Plan

**Created**: January 23, 2026
**Based on**: 2025 performance data + 2026 Meta ads research

---

## Executive Summary

Your 2025 campaign achieved **3.48x ROAS** with $8,167 spend generating 418 purchases. Key insight: **static ads outperformed video on ROAS**, but video drove volume. The multi-card Brock carousel (5.77x ROAS, $7.99 CPA) shows highest potential for scaling.

**2026 Strategy**: Lead with proven static winners, test LiquidLuck UGC videos with your winning copy, and leverage Meta's Andromeda algorithm by prioritizing creative diversity over audience targeting.

## 2026 Meta Landscape Changes

### The Andromeda Algorithm Era
Meta's new Andromeda algorithm (launched late 2024) fundamentally changed how ads work:
- **Creative IS targeting** — Meta uses your ad creative to determine who sees it
- **Audience settings matter less** — AI handles targeting based on creative signals
- **Diverse creatives essential** — Same image with different text = penalized with higher CPMs
- **Rotate every 7-10 days** — Andromeda identifies overexposed creatives faster

### What This Means for Pokemyheart
1. Your winning brown static images need **variant versions** (different layouts, angles)
2. Don't just swap headlines on the same image — create visually distinct versions
3. LiquidLuck videos are valuable because they're **authentically different** from 2025 creatives
4. UGC-style content performs better because it mirrors platform native content

- "Looking for the perfect Valentine's gift?" (intent-based)

### Urgency Triggers (ALWAYS include one)
- "Limited edition"
- "Shop now before they're gone"
- "Available only for a short time"
- "Will you be their Valentine's Day hero?"

### Benefit Stacks
- "shiny, thoughtful, and so romantic"
- "Exclusive, romantic, and designed to impress"
- "nostalgia and romance"
- "holographic shine"

### Pokemon References (use naturally)
- "I choose you"
- "Catch their heart"
- "Shiny" (Pokemon terminology)

## 2026-Specific Recommendations

### Based on Current Best Practices

1. **Rotate creatives every 7-10 days** — Andromeda penalizes stale creatives faster than before

2. **Use Advantage+ Sales campaigns** — Let AI handle targeting, focus budget on creative testing

3. **Minimum ROAS threshold** — New 2026 feature: Set 2.5x minimum ROAS threshold to protect against waste

4. **UGC outperforms polish** — LiquidLuck videos align with the "authentic beats perfect" trend

5. **Static still dominates** — Research shows static images drive 60-70% of Meta conversions; your 2025 data confirms this

6. **Hook in first 3 seconds** — For video, the opening determines everything

7. **Vertical formats only** — 9:16 for Stories/Reels, 4:5 for feed

8. **Test carousels more** — Your multi-card Brock at 5.77x ROAS suggests carousel format has untapped potential

## Risk Factors & Mitigations

|------|------------|
| LiquidLuck videos underperform | Fall back to proven static + video combo from 2025 |
| Algorithm doesn't favor content | Increase creative diversity, test more carousel formats |
| Higher CPMs than 2025 | Focus on ROAS not CPM; use minimum ROAS threshold |
| Competition for Valentine's traffic | Start earlier, establish pixel learning before peak |
