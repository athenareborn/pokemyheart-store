## Andromeda Algorithm: Creative = Targeting

### How It Works Now

With Andromeda, **your creative IS your audience targeting**. Meta analyzes:
- Visual elements (colors, composition, faces, products)
- Text overlays and hooks
- Emotional tone
- User engagement patterns

Then it finds users who respond to THAT TYPE of creative, regardless of your audience settings.

### What This Means for You

| Old Way (Pre-Andromeda) | New Way (2026) |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Target "Pokemon fans" interest | Create Pokemon-fan creative → Algorithm finds them |
| Target "Gift buyers" behavior | Create gift-giver creative → Algorithm finds them |
| One ad, multiple audiences | Multiple creatives, each speaks to ONE audience clearly |

**Key insight**: Create distinct creatives for each audience. Don't try to speak to everyone in one ad.
