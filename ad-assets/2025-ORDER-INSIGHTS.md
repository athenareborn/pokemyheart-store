## Customer Demographics

### Who's Buying?

**Predominantly Male Buyers**

Top first names: David (9), Daniel (8), Christopher (7), Michael (7), James (7), Aaron (6), William (6), Paul (6), Justin (6)

**Insight**: Your buyers are mostly men. This aligns with the gift-giver persona — men buying Valentine's gifts for their partners.

### Buying for Self vs Gift?

| Scenario | Count | % |
|----------|-------|---|
| Same billing/shipping name | 461 | 94.3% |
| Different names (likely gift) | 28 | 5.7% |

**Insight**: 94% have same billing and shipping name. This could mean:
- They're buying for themselves (collectors/fans)
- They're buying a gift but shipping to their own address first (to wrap/present it)

Either way, **the BUYER is the target**, not the recipient. Marketing should speak to the person making the purchase decision.

## Marketing Implications

### 1. Target the Buyer, Not the Recipient

Your buyers are predominantly male, buying Valentine's gifts. They're shipping to themselves (to wrap and present the gift). Target ads to:
- Men buying for girlfriends/wives
- Adults in relationships
- People searching for "unique Valentine's gift"

### 2. Push the Love Pack ($37.95)

56% of orders are the pack. In ad copy, always feature the pack as the default. Make single card feel like the budget option.

### 3. Design 1 and 2 Are Winners

Use Design 1 and 2 in your static ad creative. They're proven sellers.

### 4. Timing Strategy

| Period | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Jan 15-31 | Launch campaigns, testing creative |
| Feb 1-7 | Scale winners (peak buying) |
| Feb 8-10 | Urgency messaging ("Order by X for delivery") |
| Feb 11-13 | Last-minute hooks ("Still time!") |
| Feb 14+ | Pause or pivot to anniversary angle |

### 5. Geographic Focus

Allocate budget:
- US: 85%
- Australia: 15%

Within US, consider higher bids for CA, TX, FL.

### 6. Don't Discount

Your product sells at full price. Lead with value and uniqueness, not price cuts.
